GAME CONTEXT:
{game_context}

Provide ONE concise, actionable tip (1-2 sentences max) that the player can immediately apply.
Focus on the most impactful improvement for their current situation.

Examples of good tips:
- "Add more topspin to your forehand by brushing upward through contact"
- "Move closer to the table - you're hitting too many balls at waist height"
- "Vary your placement - you've hit crosscourt 5 times in a row"

----------------------------------------------
TECHNIQUE CORRECTION PROMPTS
----------------------------------------------

When shot speed is too low (<30 km/h):
"Speed up your swing by rotating your hips and using your legs to generate power."

When shot speed is too high (>90 km/h):
"Slow down and focus on control - consistency beats power in ping pong."

When placement is repetitive:
"Vary your shot placement - mix up crosscourt and down-the-line to keep opponent guessing."

When shot type is repetitive:
"Add variety to your shots - alternate between topspin and backspin for unpredictability."

----------------------------------------------
STRATEGIC PROMPTS
----------------------------------------------

When ahead in points:
"Maintain consistency - play safe shots and let your opponent make mistakes."

When behind in points:
"Be more aggressive - look for opportunities to attack and change the pace."

During long rallies:
"Stay patient in rallies - wait for the right ball to attack rather than forcing it."

----------------------------------------------
MENTAL COACHING PROMPTS
----------------------------------------------

After errors:
"Forget that mistake and focus on this point - every point is a fresh start."

During pressure moments:
"Take a breath and slow down - focus on your technique, not the score."
